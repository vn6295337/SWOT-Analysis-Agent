# Tavily Web Search - Business Guide

A tool that searches the web for real-time news and articles to supplement SWOT analysis.

## What It Provides

| Search Type | What It Finds | SWOT Use |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **Company News** | Recent articles about a company | Opportunities/Threats from market sentiment |
| **Going Concern News** | Financial distress coverage | Threats - early warning signals |
| **Industry Trends** | Sector outlook and forecasts | Opportunities/Threats from macro trends |
| **Competitor News** | Peer company coverage | Competitive landscape context |

## How to Interpret

### Company News Sentiment

| Signal | Examples | SWOT Category |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| Positive | "beat earnings", "upgrade", "growth" | Opportunity |
| Negative | "downgrade", "miss", "decline" | Threat |
| Neutral | General coverage | Context |

### Going Concern Risk Levels

| Risk Level | What It Means | SWOT Impact |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| None | No distress news found | No immediate concerns |
| Medium | 1-2 mentions of financial issues | Threat - monitor situation |
| High | 3+ articles on distress | Threat - significant risk |

## Complements SEC EDGAR Data

| Source | Data Type | Timeliness |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| **SEC EDGAR** | Official filings, financials | Quarterly/Annual |
| **Tavily** | News, analyst opinions, rumors | Real-time |

**Best practice:** Use SEC EDGAR for factual financial data, Tavily for market sentiment and breaking news.

## Example: Apple (AAPL)

**SEC EDGAR says:**
- Revenue: $383B
- Net Margin: 25%
- Debt/Equity: 1.8x

**Tavily adds:**
- "Apple announces new AI features" → Opportunity
- "iPhone sales exceed expectations" → Strength validation
- "Regulatory pressure in EU" → Threat

## Use Cases

- **Pre-meeting research**: Quick company news summary
- **Risk monitoring**: Check for financial distress signals
- **Competitive intelligence**: Track competitor announcements
- **Trend analysis**: Industry direction and outlook

## Limitations

- News can be speculative or biased
- Not a substitute for official SEC filings
- Search quality depends on query formulation
- Free tier limited to 1,000 searches/month
